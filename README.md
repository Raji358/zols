Zols
====

Zols is a Light weighted Content Management System built on Spring Framework. Apart from providing everything you want from a CMS, Zols is unique in three ways:

### CMS as Library
Unlike many other CMS which are webapplication, Zols is just a library(jar file) which can be easily integrated with any of your existing Spring MVC Application. There is no hassle of handling a separate deployment. 

### From HTML to CMS in no time
Zols uses strict natural templating. HTML Projects can be directly linked to CMS. Designers are free to modify HTML files which will reflect in real time within the CMS.

### Native Data Format
Content is no longer just a text. Any data we enter into zols is stored in it's native format. For E.g Dates, Time, Number etc. Which will provide the posiblity of addtional search capablities. (e.g serach pages by date range etc)
